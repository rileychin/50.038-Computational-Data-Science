# Gym pose corrector for SUTD project
1. AITrainer.py for graph plotting and csv generation
2. mean_variance_generation to generate csv files based on body angles 
3. CDS_py_ry_hy_mean_variance_classification.ipynb displays all classification models we have tried from sklearn


# TODO
1. Use frame angles instead of mean/variance 
2. Train classifier based on frame angles
3. Design neural network to output feedback for video! (if good where good, if bad where bad)
